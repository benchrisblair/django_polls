Welcome to the django-polls documentation!
========================================

The **django-polls** application is a *fictional* polls application that can be dropped into any Django project.

The application was built following the `tutorials <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/>`_ provided in the
official Django documentation. The documentation for django-polls is hosted on Read the Docs.

.. note::

   This project is simply a test environment to learn about packaging reusable Django apps. It is **not** being
   actively maintained and is in no way production ready.
